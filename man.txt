Step 1. Download crackable.sh
	- Boot Kali Linux VM and login.
	- Open Terminal
	- Type: 'git clone https://github.com/eriknj99/Crackable.git'
		- This will download crackable.sh
	- Type 'cd Crackable' to enter the newly downloaded directory
	- Type 'sh ./crackable.sh dep' to download required dependencies
		- Select 'No' when prompted about updates (Unless you have a few minutes)
	- Type 'sh ./crackable.sh help' to display all available commands 
	- Type 'systemctl start ssh' to startup the ssh server on your machine 

Step 2. Level 0
	-crackable.sh allows you to create vulnerable local users to practice cracking passwords.
	-Type 'sh ./crackable.sh l0' to begin level 0
		-This will create a local user 'level0' on your machine. level0 has password '123'
	-Connect to level0 by ssh with the command 'ssh level0@127.0.0.1', type 'yes' if prompted, then enter level0's password.
	-Type 'exit' to return to your root shell when ready.
	
Step 3. Level 1
	-Type 'sh ./crackable.sh l1' to begin level 1
		-This will create a local user 'level1' on your machine. level1 has a randomly generated 3 digit password (000-999).
	-Now lets try to crack level1's password.
		-The number of possible passwords is relatively small (n=1000) so it is feasible to try them all (Brute force).
		-Read the manual for 'hydra' and try to figure out how to crack level1's password.

	-When you have level1's password, try logging in with ssh: 'ssh level1@127.0.0.1'
	-Once again type 'exit' to return to root shell.

Step 4. Level 2
	-Type 'sh ./crackable.sh l2' to begin level 2
		-The will create a local user 'level2'. level2's password will be randomly selected from wordlist.txt.
			-wordlist.txt contains the top 100 most common passwords, if you see your password in wordlist.txt CHANGE IT NOW!
		-The possible passwords are between 4 and 10 characters long with lowercase letters and digits.
			- Thats ~3656158400000000 possible passwords!
		-Try brute forcing level2's password with same method used in level1 and you  will see why this is a problem.
	-Luckily there is a solution: 'ncrack', ncrack lets you try every password in a file rather than trying every combination of characters.	
		-Read the manual for 'ncrack' and try to figure out how to crack level2's password.
	-When you have level2's password try logging in with ssh: 'ssh level2@127.0.0.1'
	  
Step 5. Clean up
	-Run 'sh ./crackable.sh clean' to remove users level0, level1, and level2 if found.
	-You can run crackable.sh l* at any time to change the password to something else and try cracking again.
